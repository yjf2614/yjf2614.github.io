<h2 id="How-to-Instantly-Connect-with-Anyone-–-Charles-Duhigg"><a href="#How-to-Instantly-Connect-with-Anyone-–-Charles-Duhigg" class="headerlink" title="How to Instantly Connect with Anyone – Charles Duhigg"></a>How to Instantly Connect with Anyone – Charles Duhigg</h2><p>I want to ask you to take part in an experiment. After watching this video today, tomorrow, whenever you feel like it, I’d like you to find someone and ask them a question. It could be a stranger you meet on the bus, a classmate at school, your parents, maybe your friends. Here’s the question: <strong>When was the last time you cried in front of another person?</strong></p>
<p>Now, how many of you are excited about this experiment? probably not many of you. And that makes sense because it sounds kind of intimidating, even scary to ask someone a personal question like this. And then even worse, to share your own answer. But I’m going to try and convince you that this experiment is worth doing, not just once, but whenever you can. Because this kind of question has a magic power to it. It can help you <strong>instantly connect with anyone</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="💡-The-Problem-of-Mismatching-Conversations"><a href="#💡-The-Problem-of-Mismatching-Conversations" class="headerlink" title="💡 The Problem of Mismatching Conversations"></a>💡 The Problem of Mismatching Conversations</h3><p>To explain how I got interested in this, let me tell you about a bad pattern my wife and I fell into. I’d come home from work at the New York Times complaining about my day, how my boss didn’t appreciate me, or my co-workers didn’t realize what a genius I was. And my wife very reasonably would offer me some good advice, like, “Why don’t you take your boss out to lunch so you can connect better?” But instead of appreciating her advice, I would get even more upset. I wanted sympathy. I’d say things like, “Why aren’t you supporting me? Why aren’t you outraged on my behalf?” And then she’d get frustrated because I was attacking her for giving me good advice. Sound familiar? This happens in almost every relationship.</p>
<p>And so I asked neuroscientists and other researchers why I kept falling into this trap. And they told me that I was making a basic mistake. When we’re talking to someone, we think we know what that discussion is about. But what researchers have found is that every discussion actually contains <strong>multiple conversations</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="💬-Three-Types-of-Conversations"><a href="#💬-Three-Types-of-Conversations" class="headerlink" title="💬 Three Types of Conversations"></a>💬 Three Types of Conversations</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Practical Conversations:</strong> Where we’re making plans and solving problems together. We experience this mindset when we need to make a decision. For example, deciding what time should we have dinner or whose turn is it to walk the dog. When we talk about next year’s vacation or which classes we want to take, a practical conversation is taking place.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional Conversations:</strong> Where we describe how we feel. For example, the heartache of a breakup or tell stories like that hilarious time you accidentally peed your pants. An emotional conversation occurs whenever we feel a rush of pride or a sense of sorrow during a conversation. In an emotional conversation, we don’t want someone to solve our emotions. <strong>We want them to empathize.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Social Conversations:</strong> Which are about our identities, values, and how we interact with other people. When we gossip about office politics or play the name game or figure out who we know in common or explain to a friend how our religion or our upbringing or our beliefs have influenced us, made us who we are. At those moments, we’re engaging in a social conversation.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these different kinds of conversations are important, and all three may occur during the same discussion. But problems arise when two people are trying to have different types of conversations at the same time. With my wife, I was trying to have an <strong>emotional conversation</strong> and she was responding with a <strong>practical conversation</strong>. Both conversations are valid, but because we didn’t match each other because we weren’t having the same kind of conversation at the same moment, we couldn’t really hear each other. We couldn’t communicate.</p>
<h3 id="🔑-The-Matching-Principle-and-Deep-Questions"><a href="#🔑-The-Matching-Principle-and-Deep-Questions" class="headerlink" title="🔑 The Matching Principle and Deep Questions"></a>🔑 The Matching Principle and Deep Questions</h3><p>This insight is known within psychology as the <strong>matching principle</strong> which says that successful communication requires recognizing what kind of conversation is happening and then matching it either by matching you or inviting you to match me.</p>
<p>So how do we learn to match other people and invite them to match us? Well, teachers are trained that when a student comes to them for a discussion, they should start by asking: “Do you want to be <strong>helped</strong>?” (which is a practical conversation), “Do you want to be <strong>hugged</strong>?” (which is an emotional conversation), or “Do you want to be <strong>heard</strong>?” (which is a social conversation)? And that works in the classroom, but not so much in everyday life because if you ask someone at work or at school, “Do you want to be hugged?” They might look at you a little strangely.</p>
<p>So instead, there’s another tool for the rest of us: <strong>asking deep questions</strong>. A deep question invites someone to share their values, their beliefs, or their experiences. And it’s easier than it sounds. For instance, instead of asking, “Where do you work?” you can ask, <strong>“What do you love about your job?”</strong> Instead of asking, “Where’d you go to high school?” You can ask, <strong>“What was high school like? How did it change you?”</strong></p>
<p>Deep questions ask people not just about the facts of their lives, but how they feel about their lives. They invite <strong>vulnerability</strong>. And vulnerability when it’s shared is the key to real connection.</p>
<h3 id="🩺-The-Cancer-Surgeon-Example"><a href="#🩺-The-Cancer-Surgeon-Example" class="headerlink" title="🩺 The Cancer Surgeon Example"></a>🩺 The Cancer Surgeon Example</h3><p>To illustrate this, let me tell you about Dr. Afar Adai, a cancer surgeon in New York. Every day, patients come into Dr. Adai’s office having just learned they have prostate cancer. And Dr. Adai gave most of them the same advice. Surgery is risky, he would say. And this kind of tumor grows very, very slowly. So his advice was usually, don’t operate, just monitor it. In fact, pretend you don’t even have cancer. He told me he thought these conversations would be some of the easiest discussions of his life. He was telling patients that they didn’t have to have a risky surgery. But again and again, the patients ignored his advice. They went home, talked with their families, and came back insisting on surgery.</p>
<p>Then he realized it wasn’t that the patients were ignoring him. The problem was they couldn’t hear what he was saying. <strong>The solution was to ask deep questions.</strong></p>
<p>A few weeks later, when a new patient arrived, instead of explaining treatment options, Dr. Adai began the conversation by asking the man, <strong>“What does this diagnosis mean to you?”</strong> The man took a pause and then he opened up. He told Dr. Adai that his father had died when he was young and he didn’t want to put his wife or his children through that. What’s more, he worried his colleagues might see him as the sick guy and that would affect how he was treated at work. He was concerned about how his grandchildren would react.</p>
<p>Nothing that he said was about the cancer directly. The man never mentioned fears of mortality or fears of pain. But by asking a deep question, Dr. Adai learned that what this patient needed right now was not advice, but <strong>empathy</strong>. The man needed to have an <strong>emotional conversation</strong>. So, Dr. Adai in essence gave the man a hug. Now, you can’t really give someone a hug when you’re a doctor. So what he did instead is he listened to him and then he shared a few of his own experiences and then Dr. Adai said, <strong>“Do you mind if I tell you about a few treatment options?”</strong> In other words, is it okay if we move from an emotional conversation to a practical conversation together? The patient said yes and within minutes agreed to follow Dr. Adai’s advice and he never looked back.</p>
<p>This approach has transformed Dr. Adai’s practice. Most of his patients now follow his guidance and the only change is that he starts by asking a deep question. He makes a connection.</p>
<h3 id="✨-The-Final-Experiment"><a href="#✨-The-Final-Experiment" class="headerlink" title="✨ The Final Experiment"></a>✨ The Final Experiment</h3><p>So back to that experiment I mentioned, your assignment, just to remind you, is to find someone and then ask them <strong>“When was the last time you cried in front of another person?”</strong> Then after they answer, share your own reply.</p>
<p>Nick Epley, a researcher at the University of Chicago, has done this experiment hundreds of times. Beforehand, people dread it. They don’t want to do it when he tells them what’s about to happen. But afterward, nearly everyone says the same thing. They say things like, <strong>“I felt so connected to that person. I felt like they really listened to me. It was one of the best conversations I’ve had in months, maybe years.”</strong> What made it powerful wasn’t their partner or where the conversation occurred. It was powerful because it was the right kind of question, a <strong>deep question</strong>.</p>
<p>Deep questions help us figure out what conversation we’re really having, practical, emotional, or social. Right now, and I’m sure you know this, we are living in a time of polarization and division. We’ve forgotten how to talk to each other. But there’s a science for how to do it right. Super communicators aren’t more outgoing or charismatic. They’ve just learned skills like asking deep questions that anyone can learn.</p>
<p>That glow you feel after a great conversation, that sense of happiness and satisfaction, that’s your brain rewarding you. It’s proof that we’re all wired for connection.</p>
<p>So, I hope you go out and you find a stranger and then you ask them, “When’s the last time you cried in front of another person?” And then I hope you share your own story and afterwards you’ll feel like you’ve really connected with someone. Then come tell me how it went.</p>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Welcome back everyone. Take a moment to think about that person in your life. Maybe a co-worker, a friend, or even a public figure who just seems to embody everything you despise. They are arrogant, maybe they are deceitful, or perhaps they are just unbearably loud. When you see them, you feel a visceral, almost irrational wave of disgust or anger. This reaction is instant and it’s powerful. You feel a deep conviction that you are fundamentally better than they are. Now, let’s be truly honest about the person you see in the mirror. Have you ever been absolutely furious about someone else’s mistake only to realize later that day you made the exact same mistake yourself? Have you ever condemned a person for their selfishness while simultaneously justifying a selfish act of your own? This sudden gap between your high morals and your real behavior is often confusing. It can feel like you have a hidden dark passenger inside, one that acts completely against your conscious values.</p>
<div id="dplayer0" class="dplayer hexo-tag-dplayer-mark" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div><script>(function(){var player = new DPlayer({"container":document.getElementById("dplayer0"),"theme":"#FADFA3","video":{"url":"/resources/TheShadow.m4a"}});window.dplayers||(window.dplayers=[]);window.dplayers.push(player);})()</script>


<p>This dark passenger, this shadow in the soul, is precisely what we are here to explore. It is one of the most powerful and important concepts in all of Carl Jung’s work. Jung called this hidden denied part of us the shadow. It is the thing that causes self-sabotage, hypocrisy, and our most irrational emotional outbursts. It is the unlived life, the potential, both bad and good, that we have carefully locked away. Today we open the door to that darkness not to be consumed by it but to finally see it clearly. This is the first step toward true psychological wholeness. So what exactly is the shadow? In the simplest terms, the shadow is everything about ourselves that we do not want to know. It is the personal dark side of the personality. Think of it as a huge dusty basement filled with all the personality traits, instincts, and desires that the conscious mind, which we call the ego, has deemed unacceptable.</p>
<p>When you are born, your psyche is complete. A whole messy mix of every human possibility. As you grow up, you quickly learn which parts of you are rewarded by your parents, your friends, and society, and which parts are punished. For instance, expressing anger might get you sent to your room. Being too emotional might be seen as weakness. Having certain natural primal desires might be considered immoral. The job of your conscious ego is to build a socially acceptable personality. To do this, it takes all those bad or unwanted traits, the anger, the lust, the jealousy, the laziness, the intense competitiveness, and pushes them down into the unconscious. The shadow is simply the accumulation of all this repressed content. It is a part of you that has been rejected, neglected, and forced to live in the dark. It is a necessary counterpoint to your conscious identity. Jung described it profoundly when he said, “The shadow is the total personality minus the conscious attitude.” It is the whole person except the part you show the world. Because it is unconscious, we feel driven by it. But we rarely know why. This is why you sometimes act in a way that feels utterly foreign to you, as if someone else took over for a moment.” That was the shadow asserting itself.</p>
<p>Now that we know what the shadow is, let’s look at how it forms. The birth of the shadow is directly tied to the creation of another key Yian concept, the persona. The persona is the mask we wear in public. The carefully constructed image of ourselves we present to the world. It is the role we play. The good student, the devoted parent, the successful professional, the easygoing friend. From childhood, we realize that to be loved, to belong, and to succeed, we must conform. We must create a shiny, appealing persona. The persona is not fake. It is functional and necessary for social life. However, every time we choose to adopt a trait for our persona, e.g. I’m a highly organized person, we must repress the opposite trait. I am a messy lazy person. This act of repression is the fuel for the shadow. The ego committed to maintaining the beautiful functional persona acts as the gatekeeper constantly pushing unapproved parts of the self into the unconscious. The larger, more idealized, and more rigid your persona is, the bigger and darker your shadow will grow. If you are a person who publicly and aggressively champions high ethical standards, your shadow is likely filled with all the greedy, cynical, or deceitful urges you deny. If your persona is one of absolute selflessness, your shadow holds all your denied healthy needs for power, recognition, and self-care. It’s a psychological law. The light you project must cast an equally dark shadow. The shadow is the psychological price we pay for civilization.</p>
<div id="dplayer1" class="dplayer hexo-tag-dplayer-mark" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div><script>(function(){var player = new DPlayer({"container":document.getElementById("dplayer1"),"theme":"#FADFA3","video":{"url":"/resources/TheShadow2.m4a"}});window.dplayers||(window.dplayers=[]);window.dplayers.push(player);})()</script>


<p>When we talk about the shadow, most people immediately think of evil, cruelty, or malice. And yes, the shadow does contain our potential for destruction. But here is a crucial nuance that many people miss. The shadow is not only composed of negative immoral traits. It also holds our golden shadow. The golden shadow is the collection of all our positive desirable qualities, gifts and potentials that we have also repressed. Why would anyone repress something positive like courage, creativity or confidence? Because expressing these traits often comes with risk. For example, maybe you are naturally a brilliant writer or a gifted musician. But if you grew up in a family that valued only practical, highpaying careers, your passion for art may have been repressed. The ego decides that ambition is too scary or that creativity is too impractical. Instead of risking failure or disapproval, you push that gift into the shadow. It becomes a potential, a gold mine that remains unlived. When you feel a sudden intense admiration for someone who is effortlessly confident or fiercely creative, that is often a signal from your golden shadow, you are seeing a reflection of the potential you own but have chosen to deny yourself. Reclaiming the golden shadow means reactivating those potentials, the courage to ask for what you deserve, the assertiveness to set boundaries, or the creativity to truly express yourself. The shadow therefore holds both the monster and the potential hero inside us.</p>
<p>The shadow is not content to stay quietly in the basement. Since it is a living energetic part of the psyche, it constantly tries to surface. But because the ego cannot admit to possessing these denied traits, the shadow has a brilliant, subtle, and self-deceptive way of expressing itself. It uses projection. Projection is the process of taking an unconscious unacceptable quality that belongs to us and seeing it as a tangible reality in another person. It is when you point a finger at someone else and vehemently condemn a flaw that is in fact an unowned flaw of your own. You cast the contents of your unconscious mind onto the world and onto other people. Think of it like an old school movie projector. The ego is holding the lantern, but the film reel is stored in the shadow. The film plays, but you refuse to see the projector is in your hand. Instead, you stare at the screen, the other person, and loudly complain about the picture. This is why the people you intensely dislike or who make you irrationally angry are often holding up a psychological mirror to you. The key to identifying projection is the intensity of the emotion. If someone’s minor habit, say being slightly disorganized, fills you with an intense, disproportionate fury, that is a sure sign. Your conscious mind is using that other person as a screen to rage against your own denied disorganization or lack of control. Projection allows the shadow to remain unconscious while keeping the ego’s self-image perfectly clean.</p>
<p>Projection is not just a high-level psychological concept. It’s an everyday occurrence that shapes our social world and our behavior. It fuels our daily judgments, irritations, and even the larger political divides we see in the world. Learning to spot it is the beginning of the journey to self-awareness. Consider common relatable examples. You are driving and another driver cuts you off. Your reaction is a sudden boiling road rage. An intensity that seems crazy for a small inconvenience. Why? Perhaps your shadow holds denied aggression and an unexpressed desire to be selfishly dominant on the road, which you now violently condemn in the other driver. Or consider the coworker who constantly complains about the boss’s incompetence. They may be projecting their own deep-seated fear of failure onto their superior. Judgment is the easiest and most common way the shadow appears. We become moral vigilantes about the petty flaws of others. When you hear yourself speaking with unusual venom or moral outrage about a trait you are certain you do not possess, pause. That intense condemnation is a bright neon sign pointing straight back to your shadow. Jung wisely noted that what we hate or judge most intensely in the world is often a distorted mirror image of something unowned within ourselves. It is a defense mechanism. By strongly pointing out the darkness outside, we distract ourselves from the darkness inside. The shadow in daily life is the energy of our judgment. Learning to check that judgment to ask, “Is this true about me?” is the start of true self-honesty.</p>
<p>While constant projection is the quiet way the shadow operates, sometimes it breaks through the walls of the ego entirely, leading to a crisis Jung called possession. This is what happens when the denied contents of the shadow suddenly erupt into conscious life, seizing control of the personality. The ego is temporarily overwhelmed and the person acts completely out of character. Possession is often experienced as a total loss of control. Think of an uncontrollable fit of rage that leads to regrettable words or actions or a sudden devastating lapse in moral judgment. It might be a period of intense self-destructive addiction or a reckless decision that ruins a long-built career. Afterward, the ego is left bewildered, often saying, “That wasn’t me. I don’t know what came over me.” But it was you, the part of you you refused to acknowledge. This happens most frequently to people who have the most rigid, moralistic or perfect personas. They have repressed so much vital energy that the dam eventually breaks. The powerful natural urges, the drive for power, the sexual instinct, the urge to simply be lazy, build up pressure in the unconscious. When they finally burst forth, the conscious ego has no framework, no moral or ethical container for them. The person is literally possessed by an unknown part of themselves. The destructive nature of possession is the ultimate cost of denial. It is the psyche demanding that the ego finally pay attention to the parts it has rejected. The shadow cannot be permanently suppressed. It must eventually be faced or it will eventually take over.</p>
<p>If the shadow is so full of difficult negative potential, why is it considered absolutely necessary for a healthy life? The answer is simple. The shadow contains your vital raw energy. Confronting the shadow is not just about becoming a better person. It is the fundamental first step toward individuation, the lifelong process of becoming a whole integrated self. You cannot achieve psychological maturity by cutting off half of your personality. To be a complete human being means acknowledging both the light and the darkness within you. All your passion, your instinct, your vitality, and your creative power is stored there alongside your potential for cruelty. When you repress the shadow, you are also repressing the essential life force it contains. You become safe, polite, but also boring and passionless. Jung said. And this is a central theme. There is no light without shadow and no psychic wholeness without imperfection. This means that until you look your own darkness in the eye, your capacity for anger, your moments of selfishness, your tendency to judge, you remain a one-sided, incomplete, and fundamentally unconscious person. When you integrate the shadow, you do not become a worse person. You become a real person. You gain a depth of understanding and a humility that pure goodness can never offer. You gain empathy for others because you know your own faults. You reclaim the vital raw energy that was wasted on keeping the dark passenger locked in the basement. This confrontation is difficult, painful, and often humiliating, but it is the gate to real power and self-acceptance.</p>
<p>We have defined the shadow as the storehouse of everything the conscious ego denies, the dark passenger and the golden potential. We have seen how it forms through repression in service of the persona and how it expresses itself through the mechanism of projection causing intense irrational judgment of others. We’ve also acknowledged the psychological danger of possession when the denial is too great. The core lesson of this first look at the shadow is this. The shadow is not an enemy to be destroyed. It is a vital part of yourself to be owned. It is not a moral failing that you have darkness. It is a universal human fact. The real failing is the refusal to see it. The task is not to become pure light. That is impossible, but to shine the light of consciousness onto your own darkness. This process of acknowledging and integrating the shadow is what we call shadow work. It requires an intense, often uncomfortable self-honesty. It means looking at the person you despise most and asking, “Where do I do that same thing?” It means taking back all those judgments you’ve placed on the world and seeing them as parts of your own unlived life. In our next episode, we will move from definition to application. We will dive deep into the practical techniques of shadow work. How to identify your projections, how to integrate the shadow’s energy, and how to begin the slow lifelong process of making friends with your inner darkness. Thank you for being here on this crucial first step. Until next time, I encourage you to observe your most intense judgments this week. What are they telling you about yourself? We’ll see you then.</p>
