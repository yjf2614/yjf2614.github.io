<p>Went on a trip yesterday, Saw the sights, finally got away. Took a long-haul flight to Japan Despite the jet lag, I know I can…. Chorus Go away, far from home, Find new places, laugh and roam. Affordable travel is perfect for me Making memories, by the sea </p>
<p>Verse 2 </p>
<p>I went abroad, travelling on a budget, Went backpacking, oh yeah, I loved it! Eco-tourism, stayed in a cute hotel, Saw tourist attractions, now I’ve got stories to tell.</p>
</li>

<p>Back from my holiday, I’ve got spare time, Wanna take up a hobby, clear my mind. I’ll go cycling, and get in shape, The best stress busters to help me escape. Chorus I use my leisure time to feel alive, Without outdoor activities, I can’t survive, I’m at a loose end, but I can find my way, Doing what I love every single day. </p>
<p>Verse 2 </p>
<p>Sometimes I dabble in cooking too, Cook up a dish when I’m feeling blue. A form of relaxation, just for me, A creative outlet, that sets me free.</p>
</li>
<li><h5 id="Song-“Thicker-Than-Water”-https-suno-com-s-IagJ1tc6vtRg44hy"><a href="#Song-“Thicker-Than-Water”-https-suno-com-s-IagJ1tc6vtRg44hy" class="headerlink" title="Song: “Thicker Than Water” https://suno.com/s/IagJ1tc6vtRg44hy"></a>Song: “Thicker Than Water” <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://suno.com/s/IagJ1tc6vtRg44hy">https://suno.com/s/IagJ1tc6vtRg44hy</a></h5><p>Verse 1 </p>
<p>I come from a close-knit family, We laugh together, happily. Family gatherings, we share our days, Though a generation gap shows in small ways. Chorus Cause blood is thicker than water, they say, And real friendship never fades away. Through ups and downs, we stay true, I can count on them — and they count on me too. </p>
<p>Verse 2 </p>
<p>My circle of friends is always near, We hang out, catch up, and cheer. We have a lot in common, you see, And keep in touch across land and sea.</p>
