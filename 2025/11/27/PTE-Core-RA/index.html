    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>PTE Core RA(Read Aloud)题库</p>
<p><strong>1. Yellow (RA #4):</strong> Yellow is considered as the most optimistic color. Yet surprisingly, people lose their tempers more often in yellow rooms and babies cry more in them. The reason may be that yellow is the hardest color for eyes to take in. So it can be overpowering if overused.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p><strong>2. Alphabet (RA #10):</strong> The problem begins with the alphabet itself. Building a spelling system for English using letters that come from Latin — despite the two languages not sharing exactly the same set of sounds — is like building a playroom using an IKEA office set.</p>
<p><strong>3. Cat’s Paws (RA #17):</strong> In the photo, the wild cat’s huge paws are clamped onto the side of the white safari Jeep in which Chappell was a passenger. Almost as tall as the Jeep on her hind legs, she appears to be forcing her muzzle into the back window.</p>
<p><strong>4. Administration Option (RA #19):</strong> Another administration option is to bake marijuana at a relatively low temperature to kill any dangerous microorganisms and then allow that patient to eat it or drink it. Both of these methods of administration make smoking the drug unnecessary. However, criticism of medical marijuana has also been raised because as a natural plant, it cannot be patented and marketed by pharmaceutical companies and is unlikely to win widespread medical acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>5. Welfare (RA #21):</strong> Welfare has a special political meaning to the United States because it refers to how the poor receives financial aid. In comparison, Welfare services are regarded as a universal right in other regions like Europe, where it is believed that all citizens should be able to obtain a minimal level of social support and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>6. Yellow (RA #26):</strong> Cheerful sunny yellow is an attention getter. While it is considered an optimistic color, people lose their tempers more often in yellow rooms, and babies will cry more. It is the most difficult color for the eye to take in, so it can be overpowering if overused. Yellow enhances concentration, hence its use for legal pads. It also speeds metabolism.</p>
<p><strong>7. War on Women (RA #32):</strong> While the Republican field is packed with male candidates, so far, some of the sharpest Clinton critics have come from women. Democrats successfully campaigned on an alleged GOP perpetrated “war on women” in twenty twelve, but faltered in 2014 when they tried the same tactic. With Hillary Clinton as the likely Democratic nominee, the fight for women voters will be a central part of the twenty sixteen campaign.</p>
<p><strong>8. Analysts (RA #44):</strong> Analysts were impressed by the improvement in margins reported across all regions, apart from the United Kingdom, and said that this reflected a clear effort to improve profitability across the business. Although the turnaround is still in its early stages and the valuation looks full, given the challenge of turning around such a large and complex business, this is certainly an impressive start.</p>
<p><strong>9. Paper Writing (RA #49):</strong> Many papers you write in college will require you to include quotes from one or more sources. Even if you don’t have to do it, integrating a few quotes into your writing can add life and persuasiveness to your arguments. The key is to use quotes to support a point you’re trying to make rather than just include them to fill space.</p>
<p><strong>10. Classic Adaption (RA #51):</strong> A recent trend in the entertainment world is to adapt classic works of literature for either TV or movies. One argument is that this is to everyone’s benefit, as it introduces people to works they might otherwise never have, but is rarely done successfully.</p>
<p><strong>11. Atlantis (RA #65):</strong> For centuries, Atlantis has been one of the western world’s favorite legends, a tantalizing blend of fantasy and mystery. Stories tell of a rich and glorious empire that was lost to the sea – where some hope its ruins still lie, waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p><strong>12. Market Research (RA #67):</strong> Market research is a vital part of the planning of any business. However experienced you or your staff may be in a particular field, if you are thinking of introducing a service to a new area, it is important to find out what the local population thinks about it first.</p>
<p><strong>13. Learning Method (RA #110):</strong> There is no single method of learning that guarantees success. How we learn that depends on many different factors. And what works best for you will not necessarily be the same as the approach used for the other students even they study the same course. We are all unique as learners, although some patterns emerge from any groups of students.</p>
<p><strong>14. Rural Population (RA #117):</strong> Thus, a country might possess a sizeable rural population, but have an economic system in which the interests of the voters were predominantly related to their incomes, not to their occupations or location; and in such a country the political system would be unlikely to include an important agrarian party.</p>
<p><strong>15. Productive Capacity (RA #136):</strong> The core of the problem was the immense disparity between the country’s productive capacity and the ability of people to consume. Great innovations in productive techniques during and after the war raised the output of industry beyond the purchasing capacity of U.S. farmers and wage earners.</p>
<p><strong>16. Population Growth (RA #145):</strong> How quickly is the world’s population growing? In the United States and other developed countries, the current growth rate is very low. In most developing countries, the human population is growing at a rate of nearly 3 people per second. Because of this bustling growth rate, the human population is well on its way to reaching 9 billion within lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>17. Studying Topics (RA #147):</strong> In classes, your teachers will talk about topics that you are studying. The information that they provide will be important to know when you take tests. You must be able to take good written notes from what your teachers say.</p>
<p><strong>18. Breeding Areas (RA #149):</strong> Major breeding areas, and breeding islands, are shown as dark green areas or darts. Open darts are shown no-breeding records on islands, and are also used for offshore sightings, that is from ships or boats. Other areas where species are not meant to be seen are plain pale green, with pale green hatching where records are usually sparse.</p>
<p><strong>19. Studying Abroad (RA #246):</strong> Studying abroad is a very popular option for students who come from a wealthy family. Most people believe that overseas experience provides a deeper understanding of cultures and develops communication skills. While this may be true, not all of these new experiences are useful for finding a job. Employers tend to value interpersonal skills and industry knowledge more than cultural background.</p>
<p><strong>20. Girls v.s. Boys (RA #250):</strong> Teenage girls are continuing to outperform boys in English while the gender gap in achievements in math and science has almost disappeared. The figures show that last year 80% of 14-year-old girls reached at least the expected level 5 in English, compared with 65% of boys. But in math, the girls are just 1% ahead of boys, while in science the difference is 2%.</p>
<p><strong>21. Difficult Conversations (RA #252):</strong> Surprisingly, despite what appear to be infinite variations, all difficult conversations share a common structure. When you’re caught up in the details and anxiety of a particularly difficult conversation, this structure is hard to see. But understanding that structure is essential to improve how you handle your most challenging conversations.</p>
<p><strong>22. Language Appearance (RA #269):</strong> It seems that language appeared from nowhere since no other species has anything resembling human language. However, other animals do possess basic systems for perceiving and producing sounds that enable them to communicate. These systems may have been in place before the appearance of language.</p>
<p><strong>23. Lenient Parents (RA #280):</strong> Two sisters were at a dinner party when the conversation turned to upbringing. The elder sister started to say that her parents had been very strict and that she had been rather frightened of them. Her sister, younger by two years, interrupted in amazement. “What are you talking about?” she said. “Our parents were very lenient.”</p>
<p><strong>24. Fast Food (RA #288):</strong> Hundreds of millions of American people eat fast food every day without giving it too much thought, unaware of the subtle and not so subtle ramifications of their purchases. They just grab their tray off the counter, find a table, take a seat, unwrap the paper, and dig in. The whole experience is transitory and soon forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>25. Tesla (RA #293):</strong> Tesla’s theoretical work formed the basis of modern alternating current electric power systems. Thomas Edison promised him almost one million dollars in today’s money to undertake motor and generator improvement. However, when Tesla asked about the money, Edison reportedly replied “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor.” The pair became arch-rivals.</p>
<p><strong>26. Elephant (RA #302):</strong> The elephant is the largest living land mammal. During evolution, its skeleton has greatly altered from the usual mammal, designed for two main reasons. One is to cope with the great weight of huge grinding cheek teeth and elongated tusk, making the skull particularly massive. The other is to support the enormous bulk of such a huge body.</p>
<p><strong>27. Only Family (RA #316):</strong> Imagine living all your life as the only family on your street. Then, one morning, you open the front door and discover houses all around you. You see neighbors tending their gardens and children walking to school. Where did all the people come from? What if the answer turned out to be that they had always been there — you just hadn’t seen them?</p>
<p><strong>28. Father (B) (RA #326):</strong> Every morning, no matter how late he had been up, my father rose at 5:30, went to his study, wrote for a couple of hours, made us all breakfast, read the paper with my mother, and then went back to work for the rest of the morning. Many years passed before I realized that he did this by choice, for a living, and that he was not unemployed or mentally ill.</p>
<p><strong>29. Parent Teacher Conferences (RA #338):</strong> Schools host parent teacher conferences four times a year and it is important for families to attend. This is your chance to meet with teachers and ask questions about your child’s progress. It can be helpful to write down questions ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>30. Microscopic Invaders (RA #375):</strong> We all know about bacteria, viruses and microscopic protozoa. We can watch the way that these tiny agents move into our bodies and damage our organs. We have a growing understanding of how our body mounts defensive strategies that fight off these invaders, and have built some clever chemical that can help mount an assault on these bio-villains.</p>
<p><strong>31. Market Research (RA #376):</strong> There are two main types of market research. Quantitative research involves collecting a lot of information by using techniques such as questionnaires and other forms of survey. Qualitative research involves working with smaller samples of consumers, often asking them to discuss products and services while researchers take notes about what they have to say.</p>
<p><strong>32. Sleep Behavior (RA #433):</strong> Sleep behavior is also known as sleep disorder. People with sleep disorder often talk or walk in their sleep. They are not aware of what they are talking about or where they are going. There isn’t any serious effect on body in general but it may be connected to the mental health. People with childhood traumas, unspeakable problem or depression are the ones with different sleep behavior.</p>
<p><strong>33. Source of Funding (RA #463):</strong> A study found that the research funded by the soft drinks industry had different results from research funded by other sources and went on to suggest that they may have been biased by the research itself. The whole point of the scientific methods is to ensure the research results are not influenced by the source of funding.</p>
<p><strong>34. Selective History (RA #472):</strong> History is selective. What history books tell us about the past is not everything that happened, but what historians have selected. They cannot put in everything: choices have to be made. Choices must similarly be made about which aspects of the past should be formally taught to the next generation in the shape of school history lessons.</p>
<p><strong>35. Bond Funds (RA #498):</strong> Most bond funds have credit risk, which is the risk that companies or other issuers whose bonds are owned by the fund may fail to pay their debts, including the debt owed to the holder of their bonds. Some funds have little credit risk, such as those that invest in insured bonds or U.S. Treasury bonds. But be careful: nearly all bond funds have interest rate risk, which means that the market value of the bonds they hold will go down when interest rates go up.</p>
<p><strong>36. Liverpool (RA #541):</strong> Located at the heart of two world famous cities, Liverpool and London, Liverpool’s excellence in teaching, learning and research, first-class facilities and outstanding support places the university in the top 1% of universities worldwide. The University of Liverpool will provide you with an inspiring student experience, in a diverse international community.</p>
<p><strong>37. Smartphones (RA #554):</strong> Smartphones have become an everyday essential for millions of us – we rely on them for everything from updating our social media profiles to banking. Taking out a smartphone contract that bundles together your calls, data, and texts with the cost of the handset can help spread the cost – but can also mean you’ll pay more over the long run.</p>
<p><strong>38. Bad Habits (RA #556):</strong> It is very easy to acquire bad habits, such as eating too many sweets or too much food, or drinking too much fluid of any kind, or smoking, etc.. The more we do a thing, the more we tend to like doing it. In later stage, if we do not continue to do it, we feel unhappy. This is called the ‘force of habit’ and the force of habit should be fought against.</p>
<p><strong>39. Conscientiousness (RA #577):</strong> Conscientiousness is a fundamental personality trait. A conscientious person is good at self-regulation and impulse control. This trait influences whether you will set and keep long-range goals, deliberate over choices, behave cautiously or impulsively, and take obligations to others seriously.</p>
<p><strong>40. Blue Whale (RA #579):</strong> Blue whales are the largest living mammals. Though reports of maximum length and weight vary from one account to another, Antarctic blue whales are known to have reached lengths to 100 feet and weights of over 150 tons before stocks were severely depleted by whaling operations. North Atlantic blue whales may be expected to reach lengths of 80-85 feet.</p>
<p><strong>41. Canada (RA #584):</strong> With a population of only just over 30 million living in the world’s second largest country, Canada is justly renowned for vast tracts of wilderness untroubled by pollution either from industry or from intensive farming methods. A major conservation issue is the battle to stop the logging of virgin forest in northern Ontario and on the west coast.</p>
<p><strong>42. Children Helping Others (RA #590):</strong> Children as young as 14 months old will spontaneously help others for no reward. But a study of 3-to-5-year- olds found that, although they would spontaneously draw pictures, if they were given a reward for drawing pictures, then later they wouldn’t make any drawings unless a reward was offered.</p>
<p><strong>43. Charlie Parker (RA #591):</strong> Charlie Parker noticed that the solos were only improvised through the melodies, but that he could also improvise them through the chords, thus creating new variations over the structure of the songs, and also playing more notes and faster.</p>
<p><strong>44. Volunteering (RA #597):</strong> For graduates looking to give something back, volunteering, either in the UK or overseas, is a popular option. Voluntary projects can cost anything from nothing up to a few thousand pounds, and with that in mind it is essential to look into the project carefully before signing on the dotted line.</p>
<p><strong>45. Antarctic (RA #710):</strong> The world’s fifth largest continent: Antarctica is almost entirely covered by ice 2000 meters thick. The area sustains varied wildlife including seals, whales, and penguins. The Antarctic treaty signed in 1959 and enforced since 1961 provides for international governance of Antarctica.</p>
<p><strong>46. Noise Restrictions (RA #783):</strong> The noise restrictions are based on measurements on animals in captivity exposed to noise levels that induce a temporary threshold shift (TTS) in hearing. The TTS onset threshold is the lowest noise exposure capable of inducing a small temporary reduction of hearing sensitivity, also known as auditory fatigue, with full recovery shortly after exposure.</p>
<p><strong>47. Book Structure (RA #786):</strong> Any writer must decide upon an order and a structure for a book in keeping with the reflexive nature of the work. There are strong currents of reiteration in the book, with each iteration developing understandings of research, theory, and practice as the story continues to unfold.</p>
<p><strong>48. Depression Symptons (RA #787):</strong> Symptoms of depression decrease with improvements in sense of smell, particularly among patients with dysosmia. New research published in the journal Scientific Reports highlights the intricate relationship between depression and sense of smell. The study found that participants’ symptoms of depression dropped as their odor identification improved, particularly among those with an impaired sense of smell.</p>
<p><strong>49. Era of Mayan (RA #788):</strong> The Classic Era of Mayan came to an end around 900 AD. Why this happened is unclear; the cities were probably over-farming the land, so that a period of drought led to famine. Recent geological research supports this, as there appears to have been a 200-year drought around this time.</p>
<p><strong>50. Gut Microbiome (RA #808):</strong> Research has shown that the gut microbiome is important for human physiology and health. Disturbances to the composition of the gut microbiome can be associated with chronic diseases such as gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. The human body has evolved strategies to ensure that a symbiotic relationship exists between the microbes in our gut and our cells.</p>
<p><strong>51. Making Notes (RA #1012):</strong> The whole purpose of making notes is to aid your learning. It is important to go back over them within a day of making them to make sure they make sense and make them legible for future revisions. Also, going back over them should highlight the key questions of areas in which you want to do further reading.</p>
<p><strong>52. Tortoise (RA #1021):</strong> The tortoise size and shell shape varies depending on where they live. The shell is made of bone and is a dull brown color. Their ribs, backbone and breastbone have become part of the shell, which is why you can never separate the tortoise from its shell.</p>
<p><strong>53. Enough Fluid (RA #1022):</strong> Your body is nearly two-thirds water. And so it is really important that you consume enough fluid to stay hydrated and healthy. If you don’t get enough fluid you may feel tired, get headaches, and not perform at your best.</p>
<p><strong>54. Tutor (RA #1024):</strong> Your tutor helps you make the most of your time at university by giving you guidance and support along the way. All new students are allocated a personal tutor who will encourage you to get the most out of your course, direct you to other sources of support and help you achieve your goals.</p>
<p><strong>55. Rates of Depression (RA #1025):</strong> At a time when stress levels are soaring, rates of depression are increasing and the gap between rich and poor is ever widening. We believe that giving can play a positive role in helping people to feel connected to those around them and generate a sense of purpose and hope. When we give, we feel valued, useful and happy.</p>
<p><strong>56. Bill (RA #1034):</strong> The bill calls for the establishment of the National Landslide Hazards Reduction Program within one year of becoming law. The program serves numerous functions, including to identify and understand landslide hazards and risks, reduce losses from landslides, protect communities at risk of landslides hazards, and improve communication and emergency preparedness.</p>
<p><strong>57. Mass Strandings (RA #1450):</strong> Mass strandings of whales are a recurring issue in Australia and New Zealand. In recent years, multiple events have highlighted the severity of this problem. For instance, in April 2024, around 160 pilot whales stranded on a Western Australian beach, prompting a significant rescue operation by marine biologists and wildlife officers.</p>
